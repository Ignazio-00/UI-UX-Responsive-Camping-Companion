# Type of Documentation

# Conceptual Documentation

Conceptual documentation explains the underlying concepts, principles, and best practices related to a software system or technology. Conceptual documents should be useful to both experts and novices, emphasizing clarity

- **Software Architecture Overview**: This documentation will provide a high-level overview of the software architecture of Sterna Studio. It will include the different components of the software, their interactions, and the technologies used to build them. This will help the developers understand the big picture of the software and how different parts of the software interact with each other.

- **Database Logic and ER-Diagram**: This documentation will focus on the database logic and the ER-Diagram of Sterna Studio. It will explain the structure of the database, the relationships between different entities, and how the data is stored and retrieved. This will help the developers understand the database design and how the data is organized in the system.

- **CI/CD in Sterna Studio**: This documentation will focus on the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process in Sterna Studio. It will explain how the code is built, tested, and deployed in the software development lifecycle. This will help the developers understand the development process and how the changes are integrated and deployed in the system.

- **API Endpoints and CRUD Operations**: This documentation will focus on the API endpoints and the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Sterna Studio. It will explain the different endpoints available in the system, the operations that can be performed on them, and the data that can be retrieved or modified. This will help the developers understand how to interact with the system using the API.
